    "<div><p>In the last two missions, we explored how the NumPy library makes working with data easier. Because we can easily work across multiple dimensions, our code is a lot easier to understand. By using vectorized operations instead of loops, our code runs faster with larger data.</p>\n",
    "<p>Although NumPy provides fundamental structures and tools that make working with data easier, there are several things that limit its usefulness:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>The lack of support for column names forces us to frame questions as multi-dimensional array operations.</li>\n",
    "<li>Support for only one data type per ndarray makes it more difficult to work with data that contains both numeric and string data.</li>\n",
    "<li>There are lots of low level methods, but there are many common analysis patterns that don't have pre-built methods.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>The <strong>pandas</strong> library provides solutions to all of these pain points and more. Pandas is not so much a replacement for NumPy as an <em>extension</em> of NumPy. The underlying code for pandas uses the NumPy library extensively, which means the concepts you've been learning will come in handy as you begin to learn more about pandas.</p>\n",
    "<p>The primary data structure in pandas is called a <a href=\"http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html#pandas.DataFrame\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>dataframe</strong></a>. Dataframes are the pandas equivalent of a Numpy 2D ndarray, with a few key differences:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Axis values can have string <strong>labels</strong>, not just numeric ones.</li>\n",
    "<li>Dataframes can contain columns with <strong>multiple data types</strong>: including integer, float, and string.</li>\n",
